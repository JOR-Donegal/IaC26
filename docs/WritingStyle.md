# Writing Style

## Academic reports
The coursework associated with this module is intended to be done as academic reports. I provide some guidance [here](https://jor-donegal.github.io/AcademicDocumentation26/) as to how you should approach this. Please use this as a guide when you were trying to produce report documentation for this module.

It is important that in at least one module we focus on academic writing. When you need to write reports for an academic programme of study, for conferences or academic journals, you need to start by finding out what the rules are. If I'm writing a paper for conference, I start by downloading the templates that the conference organisers provide. I read through it thoroughly and to comply with it. Otherwise, I'm wasting my time making a submission. Part of the discipline of this module is for you to do the same.

My templating guidelines would be generally compliant with what is required in academia anywhere in the world. As these are short reports, I do not get you to do a literature review, and my conclusion has a prescribed format.
