# Writing Style

## Academic reports
The coursework associated with this module is intended to be done as an academic report. I provide some guidance [here](https://jor-donegal.github.io/AcademicDocumentation26/) as to how you should approach this. Please use this as a guide when you were trying to produce report documentation for this module.

When you need to write reports for an academic programme of study, for conferences or academic journals, you need to start by finding out what the rules are. If I'm writing a paper for conference, I start by downloading the templates that the conference organisers provide. I read through it thoroughly to comply with it. Otherwise, I'm wasting my time making a submission. Part of the discipline of this module is for you to do the same.

My template guidelines would be generally compliant with what is required in academia anywhere in the world. As these are short reports, I do __not__ get you to do a _literature review_, and my conclusion has a prescribed format.
