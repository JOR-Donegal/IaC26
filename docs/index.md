# Introduction

!!! abstract "Infrastructure as Code (L9)"

Welcome to this module, Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. 
I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started. 

I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.

This module is intended as a foundation module and has minimal prerequisites. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. Some of my scripting (Unix and DOS) dates back to the 1980s, but the content and structure of this module was created c. 2010 and substantially reworked for level 9 courses in 2015; it is updated annually. At the risk of making a sweeping statement, students who fully engage and keep up with the course work, pass.

If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my notes in Week 1 to understand what you need.
