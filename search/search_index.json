I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started. I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it. This module is intended as a foundation module and has minimal prerequisites. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. Some of my scripting (Unix and DOS) dates back to the 1980s, but the content and structure of this module was created c. 2010 and substantially reworked for level 9 courses in 2015; it is updated annually. At the risk of making a sweeping statement, students who fully engage and keep up with the course work, pass. If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my notes in Week 1 to understand what you need. Copyright The content of these notes are (c) John ORaw 2026. I have tried to acknowledge and cite sources, if you think I have missed crediting someone else's work, please contact me by university e-mail and I will remedy. If you find errors in my notes or something has been superseded without me noticing, please let me know. The pace of technological development assures that my notes have a very short shelf life. They are intended to be a starting point for your studies, not the end point.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Infrastructure as Code (L9) Welcome to this module, Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

I provide some guidance here as to how you should approach this. Please use this as a guide when you were trying to produce report documentation for this module. When you need to write reports for an academic programme of study, for conferences or academic journals, you need to start by finding out what the rules are. If I'm writing a paper for conference, I start by downloading the templates that the conference organisers provide. I read through it thoroughly to comply with it. Otherwise, I'm wasting my time making a submission. Part of the discipline of this module is for you to do the same. My template guidelines would be generally compliant with what is required in academia anywhere in the world. As these are short reports, I do not get you to do a literature review , and my conclusion has a prescribed format.","title":"Writing Style"},{"location":"WritingStyle/#writing-style","text":"","title":"Writing Style"},{"location":"WritingStyle/#academic-reports","text":"The coursework associated with this module is intended to be done as an academic report.
